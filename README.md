# Tideboard
A simple Angular app to display daily tide and daylight data for a location. Tide data is from: [NOAA Tides & Currents](http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/), and daylight calculations are made using [SunCalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc).

Special thanks to Mozilla and Erik Spiekermann for [Fira Sans] (https://github.com/mozilla/Fira).
